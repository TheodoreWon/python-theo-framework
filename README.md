# theo-framework

It is the framework what makes building a project easy.

DictList is the data structure to control data easily and efficiently.
Log is made to log a program by printing and storing.
System and Component make building a system easy.

I am likely waiting a any kind of contribution.


# How to use

Install the framework  
> pip install theo-framework

Print docstrings
> from theo.framework import DictList, Log, System, Component  
> print(DictList.&#95;&#95;doc&#95;&#95;)  
> print(Log.&#95;&#95;doc&#95;&#95;)  
> print(System.&#95;&#95;doc&#95;&#95;)  
> print(Component.&#95;&#95;doc&#95;&#95;)
